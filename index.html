                    to unify or balance opposites. Hatha can also mean ‘effort’, suggesting 
                    transformation through exercise of the physical body.</p>

                <p class="font big18 center_text">“Raja” comes from the Sanskrit word for “royal”.
                    The ethos behind Raja yoga is that it is our mind that creates our reality. 
                    Whatever we experience in life, pain or pleasure, it is created by our own mind. 
                    If our mind isn’t focused then we will be thrown at every turn.

                    easiest forms of yoga to master. It requires selfless love and devotion to a 
                    higher being. When we give love, we receive it.</p>

        ✩°｡⋆⸜ <i>What clothing should I wear?</i>
        <br>Any comfortable clothing that suits you: T-shirt, top, leggings, but no socks.

        <br><br>✩°｡⋆⸜ <i>What should I take with me?</i>
        <br>Absolutely nothing. We have everything in our studio.

        <br><br>✩°｡⋆⸜ <i>Maybe I have contraindications. How do I know for sure?</i>
        <br>Only the instructor can answer this question. Come to the session and check 
        with them.

        <br><br>✩°｡⋆⸜ <i>When will the first results of classes be noticeable?</i>
        <br>The body reacts quickly enough to an increase in loads, so after 8 to 12 sessions, 
        you can already notice a decrease in muscle pain, normalization of tonus and improved 
        coordination of movements.

        <br><br>✩°｡⋆⸜ <i>How many times a week do you need to do yoga to feel your best?</i>
        <br>It's individual for everyone. The most important thing is that you want to practice 
        yoga and feel energized after classes.
        Usually, for most people it's enough to have classes 2-3 times a week.
